<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-adhesion Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gel Barrier</li><li>Solution Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-adhesion barrier market includes two primary types: gel barriers and solution barriers. Gel barriers are viscous substances that create a physical separation between tissues during surgery, helping to prevent post-operative adhesions. They typically maintain their form and provide sustained protection. Solution barriers, on the other hand, are liquid formulations that can flow and spread over tissues, forming a protective layer. Both types aim to reduce complications related to tissue adhesion, leading to improved surgical outcomes and patient recovery.</p></p>
