<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporative Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Evaporative Cooling</li><li>Indirect Evaporative Cooling</li><li>Two-stage Evaporative Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The evaporative cooling market consists of three main types: direct evaporative cooling, indirect evaporative cooling, and two-stage evaporative cooling. Direct evaporative cooling involves directly passing air over water-saturated pads, cooling the air effectively for hot and dry climates. Indirect evaporative cooling employs a heat exchanger, allowing air to cool indirectly without added humidity, suitable for diverse environments. Two-stage evaporative cooling combines both methods, offering enhanced efficiency by first cooling the air indirectly, then directly, optimizing performance across varying conditions.</p></p>
