<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Alarm And Detection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Fire Detection and Alarm Systems</li><li>Addressable Fire Detection and Alarm Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire alarm and detection systems market is primarily divided into two main types: conventional and addressable systems. Conventional fire detection systems use a basic zoned approach, where multiple sensors are connected to a central control panel, triggering alarms for specific areas. In contrast, addressable fire detection systems offer greater precision, with each sensor having a unique address, allowing for real-time identification and pinpointing of fire locations. This enhances response times and facilitates targeted evacuation strategies, improving overall safety.</p></p>
